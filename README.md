# react-less-watcher
A tool for help create-react-app work with less

# Description
It is only a simple tool for compile less to css. BTW, it not only work with create-react-app also can work with command line .<br/>

When you work with it, it will create a css file at the same directory of less, and with the same name, so you import the css file in your jsx file is ok.

```
  |-src
     |-main.less
     |-main.css
```

```jsx
  import './main.css';
  ...
```

**Note** : It will takes some time to compile the less file to css file, so you'd better to create a less file first, and then import the css file or you will get a error.
